<h2>Stand on the board and bend your knees. Position yourself on the board with your front foot in the middle and your back foot near the back edge. Bend your knees slightly to prepare to jump, keeping your shoulders roughly level with your feet as you do. Make sure you can keep your balance as you do so, or else it will be off for the whole trick.
Try and stay on the balls of your feet as you crouch. If you push too far up onto your toes, your board will start spinning away from you as you jump.</h2>
